# The Boy's DND Stuff

This is a cherry pick of dnd related things from my server.  

There is a docker compose file if you want to simulate running my server.
If you start up the container you'll be able to access a local server at
`localhost:8080` in your browser and you'll be able to refresh a page and
see live updates as you make changes.  

On linux, I just run `sudo docker compose up -d`. I've long forgotten what
it is on Windows.
