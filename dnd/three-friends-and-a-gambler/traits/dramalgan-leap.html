You may perform a Dramalgan's Leap as a full-round action. When you do, you pick a straight line path up to your charge
distance and make a DC 10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check to leap.
If successful, you gain a +2 bonus to your attacks as part of this leap and a -2 penalty to AC until the
start of your next turn. For every 5 your check exceeds the DC, you gain an additional +1 bonus. Additionally,
you may make attacks against the creatures you can reach along your path.
<br><br>
If your path crosses through an enemy's space, you may attempt to move through the space using the result of
your acrobatics roll. If you provoke an attack of opportunity from this leap's movement, you may use your
acrobatics roll to not provoke. If you attack an enemy in a space you are trying to move through, you may treat your
attack roll as your acrobatics roll to move through them regardless of whether you hit or not. If you attack
an enemy you provoke from, you may treat that attack roll as your acrobatics check to avoid them.
If the target falls (either dead or unconscious) as a result of that attack, you continue along your path.
For each enemy that attacks you during the leap, you get a -2 penalty to avoid attacks of opportunity (applied only
to avoid, not the attacks themselves if using an attack roll to avoid).
<br><br>
You may continue making attacks against creatures along your path in the order that you reach them, up to the
number of attacks you would get in a full attack with the same penalties to each successive attack as a full attack.
You must continue to the end of your path if you are able or stop adjacent to another creature, terrain, or
obstacle you can grab onto or collide with (you are midair and the only way to stop is to collide with something within reach).
<br><br>
Weapons readied against a charge deal double damage when readied (set) and used against you during this leap, but you do
not get double damage from employing a lance during this leap.
