This egg is scaled like a dragon egg and weighs about the same. It is 12 inches long and 10 inches wide.

<h2>The Aura</h2>
The egg emanates an impossibly strong and long-reaching aura. Anyone on the same plane as the egg with the ability to perform magic or
with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities/">special abilities</a> immediately knows 
the general direction to and approximate distance from the egg. Those within 100 miles knows the exact location of the egg.
Beings on other planes with the ability to perform magic know which plane the egg is on.
This does not grant any knowledge about the egg, only that a powerful magic artifact exists whereever it's sensed.
<br><br>
The egg's magic aura is so strong every other aura weaker than overwhelming is imperceptible near it. It is impossible
to detect any magic aura weaker than overwhelming within 10 miles of the egg. It also makes it difficult to reliably target
the egg with magic. Any spell targeting the egg has a 90% chance to fail.
<br><br>
The aura can be hidden by spending 30 points of mythic power across a day. This will negate all magical detection of the egg
including through divination spells and prevents the egg from being targeted by magic. One additional point of mythic power
can be spent allow those contributing to the suppression to target the egg with magic. The source(s) of suppression must be
within one mile of the egg and know about its existence.

<h2>The Song</h2>
While unsuppressed, the egg emits a faint song that can be heard or sensed within 100 miles of the egg with a DC 40 perception check.
On a success, the listener gains a +2 bonus +2 bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for a day.
<br><br>
A listener can attempt to sing or play along with the song with a DC 15 perform check as a swift action.
On a success, the listener can perform along for 1 consecutive minute and anyone who can hear or otherwise sense the listener's
tune also gains the bonus.
<br><br>
Attempting to reproduce this song strains the performer regardless of success and can only be
attempted once a day without consequence. Each attempt after the first deals 1d2 Charisma damage.
Someone who succeeded earlier in the day can choose to perform along again without a check but still takes the ability damage for
each extra consecutive minute.
<br><br>
If the egg is being supressed, two additional points of mythic power can be spent to fine tune the supression so that
the song is not suppressed. The suppressor(s) can choose how far away the song can be heard up to 100 miles.
