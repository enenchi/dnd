This scope appears to be a normal scope at first glance.
Upon closer inspection, the two lenses at each end of the scope an be detached and its base morphs to attach to most surfaces.
<br><br>
Each end of the scope acts as a modified, constant <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/scrying/">scrying</a> spell that scries on the other.
In effect, looking through one lens lets the user see out the opposite side of the other lens and vice versa for both sides of the lenses.
Most spells requiring line of sight can be cast through the lenses and have a 20% chance of success per caster level.
In addition, the following spells have a 100% success chance: <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-chaos">detect chaos</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-evil">detect evil</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-good">detect good</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-law">detect law</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-magic">detect magic</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/m/message">message</a>.
<br><br>
Each lens can be worn as a monocle and the holder of the body of the scope knows where each lens is as if it were affected by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/guiding-star">guiding star</a> instead of a locale.
Once per day, the body of the scope can be used to return (via <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/teleport/">teleport</a>) both lenses to it.
<br><br>
When using both lenses attached to the scope, the user gains a +3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">cicumstance</a> bonus to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">perception</a>.
When also mounted to a ranged weapon, the user gains a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">cicumstance</a> bonus to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack</a> and the weapon's range increment increase by 10 ft.
<br><br>
Once a day, the scope gains one charge of a random detect spell.
This refreshes at midnight and any user automatically knows which spell is contained.
Activating this does not require a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/use-magic-device/">use magic device</a> check and does not require concentration to maintain, but once active, it lasts the full duration.

Additionally, once per day, if the lenses and scope are together, it can be used to cast <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mending/">mending</a> on the object it's attached to.
<br><br>
<mark class="mythic">
The holder of the body of the scope can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to turn both lenses of
the scope into portals of the same size as the lenses for up to one minute. The directions the portals work in and are
connected in are the same as how scrying through them work. While they are portals, spells can be cast through them
and have a 30% chance of success per caster level, up to 90%. Detect spells and message still have 100% success chance.
<br><br>
Additionally, during this minute, the holder of the body of the scope can cast random detect spells at will and can
cast <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/m/message">message</a> at will. Unlike the scope's standard
detect spell, this does not modify the detect spell in any way.
<br><br>
Others <i>bonded</i> can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to use the body of the scope as the source of
an effect they perform for up to one minute. If the effect lasts longer than a minute, it returns to the previous source
afterwards. If the effect was not active before and lasts longer than a minute, the source that it will return to must
be chosen before activating. They also gain the ability to cast random detect spells and
<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/m/message">message</a> at will.
