This masterwork <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a> is made of a mysterious dark metal that absorbs heat when unsheathed.
Frost billows out from its dark blade and collects onto the ground.
<br><br>
When plunged into a liquid, the blade freezes a 1 ft block around itself in 1 minute. Swinging the blade
leaves snow flurries in its wake regardless of the current weather.
<br><br>
Once a day, the blade can be used to cast <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-water/">create water</a>,
treating their HD as their caster level.
<br><br>
This weapon counts as cold iron for the purposes of overcoming DR, and all damage from this weapon is cold damage.
If a creature has DR that is overcome by cold iron, this weapon deals an additional amount of damage equal to the DR.
If a creature is vulnerable to cold, this weapon deals twice the amount of damage instead of +50%.
If a creature is immune to cold, this weapon ignores its immunity.
These apply to the wielder as well. These do not apply if the traits were granted through deific means.
<br><br>
Wielding the blade with malice causes it to emanate a 10 ft. radius aura of frost.
Any creature that the wielder holds malice towards takes 1 point of cold damage each turn.
This applies to the wielder as well.
<br><br>
Once a day, as a free action, the wielder can emit a 30 ft. aura of sorrow and despair for 1 min per HD of the wielder.
Anyone in the aura may resist the effects with a successful DC 20 Will Save. If successful,
nothing happens and this aura cannot affect them the rest of the day. If they fail,
they become depressed and despondent. They are treated as if under the effects of
<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/burdened-thoughts/">burdened throughts</a> and
<a href="https://legacy.aonprd.com/coreRulebook/spells/crushingDespair.html#crushing-despair">crushing descpir</a>.
The wielder is not subject to this aura.
<br><br>
Once a day, the wielder can choose to begin a "<i>path of vengeance</i>" by choosing a target no closer than 80 ft as their adversary.
When wielder begins this <i>path of vengeance</i>, the blade's hilt grows ice around the wielders hand, making it impossible to
disarm the wielder while it is frozen. This ice takes 20 points of fire damage to melt and regenerates itself every round.
<br><br>
Starting a <i>path of vengeance</i> counts as wielding the blade with malice. The ice around the wielder's hand deals an additional 1
point of cold damage each round. The adversary is treated as if in the aura of sorrow and despair (DC 25 to negate).
<br><br>
Until the <i>path of vengeance</i> ends, the wielder and their adversary cannot move more than 5 ft. per round. The wielder must
move towards their adversary as best as they can. Each round the <i>path of vengeance</i> lasts, both wielder and adversary take
a stacking -1 penalty to perception on sensing anything other than each other until all they can see, hear, or sense
is their opponent and the path between them. The wielder nor adversary can be healed during this time and both cannot be affected by mind-affecting effects.
If either are under a mind-affecting effect, it is suspended until the <i>path of vengeance</i> is over.
<br><br>
If the wielder reaches within 30 ft of their adversary, the adversay is treated as if under the effects of the aura
regardless of any previous successful saves against it. Additionally, once within 10 ft, the wielder can coup de grace
their adversary if within reach as a move action regardless of requirements to do so.
When chosen, the adversary immediately knows how the <i>path of vengeance</i> works and that the wielder reaching them means death.
<br><br>
The <i>path of vengeance</i> lasts until the adversary or wielder is dead, the wielder dismisses the <i>path of vengeance</i>, or the wielder
is disarmed. If the path of vengance ends from the wielder dying or being disarmed, the adversary takes damage equivalent
to twice the amount of damage the wielder took while the <i>path of vengeance</i> was active.
<br><br>
Moving the wielder or adversary takes a DC 20 Will Save each turn and places the mover under the effects of the aura without any save.
If the wielder is attacked, the attacker takes damage equal to the amount the wielder took. All damage from this <i>path of vengeane</i>
counts as coming from this blade.
<br><br>
At any time, the wielder can choose to plunge the blade into their heart and choose an adversary. The blade immediately turns
the wielder to ice, freezing them as if under the effects of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/temporal-stasis/">temporal stasis</a>
except the wielder can take actions that assist them in moving towards their adversary. During this time, the adversary
cannot move from their location, cannot leave the plane, and cannot teleport. Once the wielder reaches the adversary,
they can touch them to immediately turn their adversary to ice. The temportal statsis effect then ends, at which point
both wielder and adversary die. They remain frozen together and cannot be restored other than by wish. Even through
wish, restoring one will restore the other.
