These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipmenT/special-materials/#mithral">mithral</a> bracelets are simple but elegant bands that shrink or expand to fit around a willing creature's body.
They can be interlocked together into one band with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#standard_action">standard</a> action. Donning or doffing one individual band or both interlocked bands is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/combat/#full-round_action">full-round</a> action as the bands take time to adjust their size.
<br><br>
When separated, the bands prevent itself and those wearing it from leaving the plane they are on as the spell <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimensional-anchor/">dimensional anchor</a>, except that it also prevents summoned creatures from disappearing.
Instead, if a summoned creature would disappear, they instead fall unconscious and cannot be made conscious again and disappear when the band is removed.
If an eidolon wears a band, it can wear armor but still shares magic item slots with its summoner.
<br><br>
Touch spells can be cast through the bracelet to affect any wearer of a bound bracelet.
Casting a touch spell though the bracelet worn by a creature unwilling to allow the spell requires a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/called-shots/">called shot</a> to the arm with a -5 penalty.
The bracelets can be used to cast <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/accept-affliction">accept afflication</a> at will targeting a wearer of the bonded bracelet without requiring any checks or spell components.
<br><br>
Wearing the bracelets also grants abilities or bonuses depending on where the bracelet is worn and how many. Wearing a bracelet does take up a magic item slot.

    <sup>4</sup>Wearing interlocked bands on one part does not grant anything. The 2 band effect is gained from wearing one band on each part.

<mark class="mythic">
The wearer or wearers of the bands can expend a use of mythic power to double the numerical bonuses of any one-band effects
they are benefiting from for up to one hour. For the breath weapon, this effect doubles your effective dragon HD.
<br><br>
Others <i>bonded</i> can expend one use of mythic power to receive one of the active one-band effects as if they were
wearing the band for up to one hour. Receiving an effect in this way does not take up a magic item slot.
