</p>
<p>
Storing a trait in the wrap requires the hide, scale, or feather of a creature the wielder of these wraps partook in slaying.
The wraps must have been worn for the entire duration of the combat.
Within 24 hours of slaying the creature, the wielder must perform an hour long ritual while sewing the piece of the creature onto the wraps.
The trait is chosen at the start of the ritual and is bound to the piece sewed onto the wraps and only one trait can be taken
from a creature.
Valid traits are up to GM discretion and are based on the wielder's stats, not the originating creature's.
<br><br>
Each wrap has 10 slots for traits and each trait takes up a number of slots depending on the type of trait and sacrificed
creature. The trait slots used are fixed dependent on the creature and cannot be lowered for a lower benefit.

    <sup>4</sup>This requires a ritual for each wrap, but you may do multiple rituals from one creature unless you exceed the 24 hour time frame.

    <sup>5</sup>Each wrap must be used to activate the trait at all.
</p>
<p>
Activating a trait takes a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round</a> action as the piece with the trait overtakes the full length of the wraps, merges with the wielder's body, and transforms into the appropriate body part to grant the trait.
The wraps must be wrapped around a relevant part of the body to grant the chosen trait.
This activation takes no somatic or verbal components and does not consume the piece with the trait.
The wraps stay like this until willingly returned to their original form which takes another <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round</a> action.
