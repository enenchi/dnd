<p>A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> cannot get free while the mimic is alive without removing the adhesive first. A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coatd mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save. A successful DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> check is needed to pry off a stuck weapon. Strong alcohol or <i><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/r-z/universal-solvent" class="spell">universal solvent</a></i> dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic can still <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies. The save DC is Strength-based.</p>
