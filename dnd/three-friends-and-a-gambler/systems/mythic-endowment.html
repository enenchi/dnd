<h1>Mythic Endowment</h1>

<b><i>*Any Pathfinder ability that uses mythic power requires double the amount that it says it does.*</i></b>

<h2>Mythic Heroes and Tiers</h2>
<p>
When a character is endowed with any amount of mythic power, they become a
<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic/mythic-heroes/">mythic hero</a>.
As a character is endowed with more mythic power, they reach higher tiers of myth.

<h2>Sacrificing</h2>
<p>
Mythic power can be sacrificed to to accomplish last ditch efforts of great importance. In sacrificing mythic power,
heroes give up an amount of mythic power to achieve something, possibly lowering their tier, abilities, or even
losing their status as mythic.
<br><br>
<b>Breath of Life</b>: Sacrificing one unit of mythic power, the hero can return someone to life, fully restored as
if by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-resurrection/">true resurrection</a>. The creature
resurrected must have died no longer than one year ago. This can resurrect even constructs and undead creatures.
When resurrecting undead creatures, it must be stated whether the creature is resurrected as living or undead.
This can also resurrect a creature who is currently undead, in which case the undead creature is immediately
destroyed and then returned as living. This is a full-round action.
</p>

<h2>Endowing</h2>
<p>
Mythic power can be endowed to other people or objects. It takes 1 minute to endow one unit of mythic power to
someone or something else. A mythic hero cannot endow their power if it could cause them to lose the ability of
endowing.
</p>
<h3>Endowed Objects</h3>
<p>
Endowed objects contain mythic power that can be used by any mythic hero. Additionally, anyone - mythic or not - can use
an endowed object to "endow" themselves with the mythic power inside. This takes 1 minute per unit of mythic power
and, unlike regular endowing, happens all at once instead of gradually.
<br><br>
Endowed objects are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic/mythic-magic-items/legendary-items/">difficult to destroy</a>.
Additionally, endowed objects with at least four units of mythic power count as epic for overcoming DR/epic.
