<h3>Shielding Others</h3>
<p>
If one or more allies within reach are targeted by a non-martial effect that comes from a direction, you can move them
to put yourself in the way instead and shield them as an immediate action. You cannot shield allies from homing effects
like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-missile/">magic missile</a> and similar effects.
<br><br>
You take the place of the ally that was closet to the source of the effect and your allies to move to the square
directly behind you. Both you and your allies must be able to move to the resulting locations and you cannot move more
than half your move speed during this move.
<br><br>
Immediately after the effect ends, your allies move to the closest available square until no allies are sharing squares.
You and your shielded allies do not threaten squares until their next turn as you all recover from the sudden shift.
<br><br>
You forgo any saving throw you may have had otherwise as you take the brunt of the damage and allies that you moved are
no longer considered targets of the effect. As you move and shield your allies, you expose yourself to more of the effect
as well. If saving throws are allowed, you must make additional saving throws for each ally that you shielded. Otherwise,
you take the damage each ally shielded would have been hit with without saving throws.
<br><br>
You do not gain the normal benefits of evasion or improved evasion. However, allies with evasion and improved evasion move
more reflexively and require less effort on your part and if you have evasion or improved evation, you move yourself and
your allies more deftly.

<h4>Example:</h4>
Suppose a barbarian with a reach of 5 ft. and his allies (a human, a leshy, and a pixie) are targeted by a 30 ft. cone
breath weapon. The barbarian can reach the leshy and the pixie, as shown by the green square. 
<br>

<br>
He moves to the closest location to the source that was previously occupied by an ally within reach: where the leshy
was. All shielded allies are moved to the square behind him.
<br>
<img src="combat-resources/shielding-others-fig-2.png" width="400">
<br>
After the cone effect resolves, the leshy and pixie move to the closest square until they no longer share a space.
In this case, the pixie chooses to move one square left.
