<p>This item acts and looks like an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/e-g/efficient-quiver">efficient quiver</a> with a few exceptions. The second compartment, instead of holding what it usually would, holds up to 6 wands. The third compartment, instead of holding up to 6 objects, only holds up to 4. Additionally, when a wand or other magical item is placed inside, the quiver appears to visibly shimmer and audibly hum with magic. A wearer can suppress the shimmering and/or the humming as a move action, but should the quiver be taken off, it will resume shimmering.
<br><br>
If a wand or other magical item is inside the quiver and its effect does not consume it, the user can use its effect as if they were wielding that item instead of the item they are currently wielding for the duration of the effect. This does not allow the user to stack magical abilities unless it would be possible to do so while wearing or holding all the necessary items. If a bonded object is in the quiver, the user counts as touching it. Additionally, if the quiver's shimmering and humming are not suppressed, any magic items in the quiver as well as any magic auras of the wearer are hidden as if by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/nondetection/">nondectection</a> (DC 21).
<br><br>
The quiver itself can be used to store up to <mark>10</mark> levels of spells (either divine or arcane, or a mix of both). A level 0 spell is treated as having a spell level of 1/2 (two level 0 spells take up as much storage as a level 1 spell). Each spell has a caster level equal to the caster level that it is stored at. The user need not provide any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">material components</a> since the component is consumed when storing the spell or focus to cast the spell, and there is no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/armor#TOC-Arcane-Spell-Failure-Chance">arcane spell failure chance</a> for wearing armor (because the user need not gesture). Casting a spell from the quiver has the same <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Casting-Time">casting time</a> as the time it would take to cast the spell. When a spell is stored, the quiver also appears to visibly pulsate with magic.
<br><br>
A spellcaster can cast any spells into the quiver, so long as the total spell levels do not add up to more than <mark>10</mark>. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats">Metamagic</a> versions of spells take up storage space equal to their spell level modified by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats">metamagic feat</a>. A spellcaster can use a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/scrolls">scroll</a> to put a spell into the quiver. The quiver magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells currently stored within it.
<br><br>
<mark>In addition to storing spells, the quiver If the user has the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Magus/#TOC-Spell-Recall-Su-">spell recall</a> ability, they can use it to recall a spell for one less point from their arcane pool if the spell is stored in the quiver. This does not consume nor cast the spell from the quiver.</mark>
<br><br>
At the start of each day, roll <mark>a d% and make a caster level check. The user can add or subtract any number up to the result of the caster level check to the result of the d%, treating a roll of 00 as 0 instead of 100. The corresponding effect in the following table can then be</mark> applied to one of the spells currently stored in the quiver. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats">Metamagic feats</a> applied to spells in this way do not take up more storage space. Only one effect can be applied to a spell and a new effect cannot be put on a stored spell that already has one of these effects unless otherwise specified.

<p class="footnote">
<sup>1</sup>These effects can be applied multiple times on the same effect and they stack.

<p>
The user chooses which spell to place the effect on at the start of the day if possible. If the effect cannot be placed or the user chooses not to place an effect, the effect is wasted.
<br><br>
For each bow made of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipmenT/special-materials/#Spiresteel">spiresteel</a> stored in the quiver, the wearer can touch <mark>an item weighing less then 200 lbs.</mark> and designate it to receive the ability to cast any spell stored in the quiver. This connection is broken if the spiresteel bow is removed from the quiver or if the quiver and the <mark>bonded item</mark> are not on the same plane.
<br><br>
The quiver can be unfolded into a thin <mark>8</mark> ft by 5 ft sheet of leather. When unfolded, all items stored inside continue to be stored on the Ethereal Plane. The sheet can be written on in ink and is equivalent to <mark>100 pages</mark>. Ink on the quiver can be removed by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prestidigitation/">prestidigitation</a>. When unrolled, all items and spells stored in the quiver are inaccessible. Touching the quiver still counts as touching a bonded object if one is stored inside it.
<br><br>
The unfolded quiver has an area roughly the size of four pages outlined in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipmenT/special-materials/#Elysian_Bronze">elysian bronze</a>. Ink does not stick here. Wrapping a scroll containing a spell up to level four in an elysian bronze arrow and touching it to this area immediately consumes both the arrow and the scroll to transfer the scroll's spell to the quiver. <mark>Any spellcaster with a spell slot of the level of the scroll</mark> can use their spell slot to cast that spell. <mark>A prepared caster with the spell on their class spell list can exchange a prepared spell of an equivalent level to cast the spell instead. If the caster who cast the spell does not have the spell on their class list, it consumes the spell, leaving the area blank again.</mark> Touching another scroll-wrapped arrow to the area replaces the existing spell.
<br><br>
The unfolded quiver can be refolded, magically expanding, shrinking, thinning and/or thickening, into a few forms: the original quiver, a lightweight <mark>4</mark>-person <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipmenT/vehicles/#Rowboat">rowboat</a>, a small <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipmenT/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear/#Tent">tent</a>, or a cloak. This process takes 1 minute regardless of the form taken. Any writing on the unfolded leather cannot be seen when in any of these forms. A wearer may still cast the spell in the elysian bronze outlined area. Items stored in the quiver are only accessible when in its quiver form, but all other capabilities are useable in any form..
