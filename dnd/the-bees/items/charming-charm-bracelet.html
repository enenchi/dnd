<br><br>
<b>Severed Hand</b>: This slightly disturbing silver charm looks like a bloody severed hand. While on the bracelet, for five minutes a day, the wearer can detach the hand wearing the charm. This time need not be spent consectuvely but must be spent in 1 minute increments. While detached, the wearer takes 1 point of bleed damage each round.
<br><br>The hand can be moved up to 10 ft. as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> to a maximum distance of 30 ft. away from the wearer. The hand can be used to deliver touch spells that are cast on it or that were already cast before it was detached. The hand can be used to attack, but cannot flank nor threaten squares around it. Anything it holds or picks up counts toward the carrying capacity of the wearer.
<br><br>
The hand has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/paizo-rogue-advanced-talents/improved-evasion-ex/">improved evasion</a>, the wearer's save bonuses, and an AC of 22 (+8 size, +4 natural armor).

<br><br>
When the duration ends, the effect is dispelled, or the wearer stops it, the hand disappears from where it is and returns to the wearer. Anything, including items and charges of spells, the hand did not originally have when was detached, is dropped or discharged without any effect. If the hand is destroyed, the wearer stops taking bleed damage but the hand does not return. Instead, it regrows at the start of the next day. If this charm is removed from the wearer while the hand is detached or missing, the wearer begins taking 1 point of bleed damage each round.
