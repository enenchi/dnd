This lantern appears to be a normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-GEAR/#TOC-Lantern">waterproof lantern</a>. When the lantern's <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items#TOC-Command-Word">command word</a> is spoken, it behaves as if under the effects of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dancing-lantern/">dancing lantern</a>. While it under this effect, a knob on the outside may be turned to produce a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/continual-flame/">continual flame</a>. The knob can be turned to vary the brightness of the flame. This, in effect, changes the radius of the effect of the light. The lantern can also be lit by normal means.
<br><br>
Upon closer inspection (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> DC 20) of the lantern's flame (regardless of the origin of the flame), small ghostly images of <mark>objects can be seen floating in the lantern.</mark>. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/archetypes/paizo-investigator-archetypes/lamplighter-investigator-archetype/">lamplighter</a> automatically notices the images when observing the lantern.
<br><br>
While touching the lantern's flame, as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, the holder can choose an area within 10 ft. of the lantern and summon forth one of the images in the flame. The image leaves the flame and grows in size up to its proper size as it moves to the chosen area. Once there, the image seems to be solid and can be used by anyone for its intended purpose and has the properties of the original item or structure. If the lantern is further than 100 ft. from the image, the image disappears.
<br><br>
Each image gives off light as bright as that of the flame in the lantern. If the flame is extinguished or the light from the lantern is completely blocked from reaching the image, the image disappears and reappears in the flame if the flame has not been extinguished or if it has, the next time a flame is lit in the lantern. The holder of the lantern can touch an image as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a> to return it to the flame.
<br><br>
When the lantern's flame is produced from the knob or any magical source, any image produced from it is still ghostly and does not provide <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Cover">cover</a> nor <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a>, does not block line of sight, and has no physical form except for using the image for its intended purpose.
<br><br>
When the lantern's flame is lit by magical means (including the knob) by a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/archetypes/paizo-investigator-archetypes/lamplighter-investigator-archetype/">lamplighter</a> or with fuel, any image produced from it does provide <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> and block line of sight except it still has no physical form for purposes other than its intended use. However, any object or creature passing through it (as when not using it for its intended use) takes 1d6 points of fire damage <mark>per 5 ft. square that is moved through</mark> and is outlined with light equivalent to that of a torch, for 1d6 minutes as if having passed through a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/campfire-wall/">campfire wall</a>. If summoned onto an object or creature, it receives a DC 14 Reflex save to negate all damage. If lit by fuel, the flame only burns for 1 hour per pint of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-GEAR/#TOC-Oil">oil</a>.
<br><br>
<mark>
A lamplighter can take any metal key and using a flame with heat in the lantern, brand the key's shape onto someone's skin. This bonds the key, the person, and the lantern together. This process can be repeated any number of times with any number of people. The bound key can be summoned and unsummoned by its owner as a swift action. An owner of a key can spend 5 consecutive rounds to summon a door. This door is colored like a flame and seems to flicker but does not produce light.
<br><br>
Once the door is summoned, when a bound key is touched to it, fiery material expands out from it to form a small house. The walls extend 10 feet into the ground, anchoring it in place. It expands in 1 round, any anyone caught in the rapidly expanding building takes 5d8 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 16 Half). The walls, floor, and roof have 90 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 10.
<br><br>
If the house is summoned and another bound key attempts to summon the door, the house may or may not be called based on the priority of the bound key. The lantern acts as a key and has the highest priority, a key bound to a lamplighter has the next highest priority, and all other keys have the same priority. The house only dematerializes if the bonud key trying to summon it is a higher priority. If a lower priority key attempts to summon it, the owner of the bound key that summoned the house is mentally alerted that someone else is trying to summon the house.
<br><br>
The exterior of the house appears similarly to the door. When the flames flicker, they reveal what is on the other side of the house, not what is inside. The structure and contents of the house is maintained across summonings of the house, but anyone with a key can restructure the house when they touch their key to the door when they summon it. The house must be within a 20 ft by 30 ft rectangle, under 60 ft tall, and under 2000 sq. ft. If the house is restructued to smaller than the objects inside require, objects are randomly dropped at the door until the contents fit inside the restructured house.
<br><br>
Everything inside the interior functions as it would normally. Initially, the house is empty except for the components of an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipmenT/goods-and-services/tools-kits/#TOC-Lab-Alchemist-s">alchemist's lab</a>, a crucible, a filter, a retort, a bed, and a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipmenT/goods-and-services/containers-bags-boxes-more/#TOC-Chest">medium chest</a>.
<br><br>
The bed fits only one medium creature or an equivalent amount of smaller creatures. Additionally, it cares for any creatures that rest on it, effectively providing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal#TOC-Long-Term-Care">long-term care</a> to those creatures.
<br><br>
Once per day, as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/archetypes/paizo-investigator-archetypes/lamplighter-investigator-archetype/">lamplighter</a> may pull out from the chest all the standard tools required to make checks for any one <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft">Craft</a> skill. Once summoned, they remain for 24 hours, until the chest image disappear, or the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/archetypes/paizo-investigator-archetypes/lamplighter-investigator-archetype/">lamplighter</a> touches them to unsummon them (this does not require a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Free-Actions">move action</a>), whichever comes first. Anyone may use these tools once they are summoned.
<br><br>
If the house is damaged and a fireplace exists inside the house, fuel can be burned in the fireplace to repair the house. Burning fuel this way repairs 10 hit points per hour and only one fireplace can be used to repair the house at once.
<br><br>
The owner of the bound key that summoned the house can dismiss the house as a full-round action. If any creatures are in the house when it is dismissed or dematerialized, the creatures appear on the ground at the same horizontal position they were at inside the house. All unattended objects remain in the house.
<br><br>
To destroy a bound key, it must be held in the flame of the lantern overnight. Once destroyed, the brand fades from the owner of the key.
<br><br>
At the start of the day, the bearer of the lantern can choose up to 10 objects from inside the house to appear as an image in the lantern's flame. These objects must each be less than 10 ft. by 10 ft. and total less than 100 gp. As a standard action, the lantern bearer can sacrifice an image from the lantern to create a 5 ft. radius burst of fire center at a point within 30 ft. of the lantern. This burst deals 1 damage per 5 gp the item is worth.
<br<br>
The items are temporarily lost, but can be recovered by burning fuel in any fireplace in the house. Any number of fireplaces can be used for this and items recover at a value of 2 gp per hour. Once the total value of the item is recovered, the item materializes in the house where it used to be. If there is something where the item was or if the house was restructured, it appears in a random spot in the house. If there is no room in the house, it drops next to the lantern or the door, whichever has more room next to it.
<br><br>
The door to the house can also be sacrificed in a burst of flame. The door need not be summoned already and can only be sacrificed by a lamplighter bearing the lantern. This burst of flame has a 15 ft. radius centered at a point within 100 ft. of the lantern, only targets those the lantern bearer wants, deals 50 true damage and 50 fire damage to enemies, and heals allies for 50 hit points. The true damage cannot be dodged or reduced, but the fire damage allows a Reflex Save DC 20 to halve the damage. Once sacrificed, the door cannot be restored and the house no longer summoned and everything inside the house is scattered across the Ethereal Plane.

(I want to make a JS thing for editting the layout so everyone can see and edit but for now, use this I guess: <a href="https://petermyster.com/nextcloud/apps/files/?dir=/Players&fileid=167972">whiteboard</a>. Your username is your first name in all lowercase, your password is your discord name. except for Jo whose password is his character's name in all lower case appended to the front of his discord name cuz his discord name was in a list of unsafe passwords apparently. Then click on Lantern-Interior. There is a save button in the top-right corner)
