            <b>Environment</b> warm beaches, temperate forests <br>
            <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or colony (3-20) <br>

            Smellicans are characterized by a long beak, a large throat pouch used for catching prey and draining water from scooped-up contents before swallowing, their ability to spray a very unpleasant-smelling liquid from their butt, and distinctive striped markings. <br> <br>
            They have moderatedly enlongated bodies with relatively short, well-muscled legs and long front claws for digging. They have five toes on each front foot and webbed back feet. They have a long neck with a tiny tongue to avoid hindering swallowing bigger fish. Their wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight. A smellican's coat is made up of very densely packed hairs and functions to keep the animal warm, help it float in water, and protect it against the teeth and claws of predators.<br> <br>
            Their fur coloration varies in appearance from black-and-white to brown, cream, or ginger colored, but all have warning coloration while their plumage is predominantly pale or gray depending on the species. The bills, pouches, and bare facial skin of all species become brighter before breeding season commences. <br> <br>
            Smellicans frequent inland and coastal waters, feeding principally on fish. However, they have been seen to venture further inland to cross from coast to coast. While inland, they feed primarily on small insects, larvae, earthworms, grubs, rodents, lizards, salamanders, frogs, snakes, birds, moles, eggs, berries, roots, leaves, grasses, fungi, and nuts. Rarely, they can be seen acting as scavengers.
