A faint blur appears where there is an invisible creature, giving the wearer a +10 bonus to Perception to see invisible creatures and objects.<br>
<br>
The wearer also becomes uncannily skilled at seeing Limgar. The wearer gains a +10 bonus to Perception to see Limgar and can make Perception checks to see Limgar even through total cover. If successful and Limgar is invisible or behind cover, the wearer sees a translucent image of Limgar overlaid where he is. Whether you see just Limgar (sans clothes) depends on if you conceptualize "Limgar" as just him or him and his equipment.<br>

The sun-glasses are hard to see through, imposiving a -4 penalty to sight-based Perception checks as well as protecting the wearer from the effects of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Light-Sensitivity-Ex-">light sensitivity</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Light-Blindness-Ex-">light blindess</a> due to sunlight, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/daylight">daylight</a> spell, or similar <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/light">light</a> effects.<br>
