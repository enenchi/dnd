<br>
The wearer can use a move action to activate a 15 ft cone of light that emits from the top of the ring. This light acts as the light spell. It is a swift action to disable it. There is an area in the cone unaffected by the light in the shape of a burning rock. <br>
<br>
While in an area of bright light, the ring shines brightly, allowing the wearer to reflect light at nearby foes as a move action. When they do so, creatures adjacent to the wearer must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 round. <br>
<br>
The sunsilver and singing steel resonate and reflect both light and sound. While in an area of bright light, the ring resonates, allowing the wearer to attempt a DC 10 Perform check to sing, dealing 1d4 sonic damage to all enemies within 5ft (no save). <br>

<h2>Desciption</h2>
<p>
A silvery ring with a gold undertone. A web of slightly blue-er silver runs across the top of the signet ring.

Wearing it, the metal feels unnaturally cold but warms up eventually. When you forget it's there, you feel a chill on your finger, but when you go to touch it, it's warm like your skin and the chill is no longer there.

Attuned to the aspect of introspection and adaptation.
